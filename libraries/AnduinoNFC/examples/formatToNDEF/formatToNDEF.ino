 /******************************************************************* 
  Example sketch utilizing AnduinoNFC to format a Mifare Classic
  tag as an NDEF tag. The revertToClassic sketch will reverse this
  process. Mifare Ultralight tags may also be formatted via this 
  sketch but can not be reverted!
  
  Check out the included Arduino sketch examples and Anduino Wiki to 
  get started!
